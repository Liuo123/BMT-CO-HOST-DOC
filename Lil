    <h1>BMT-Co-Host Documents</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this Basic Military Training. I'm your co-host (Name). You refer to me as STAFF and STAFF only. Understood?</p>

    <div class="rules">
        <h2 class="section-title">Rules</h2>
        <p>The following rules will be in place throughout this event:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Permission to Speak (PTS) is in effect, meaning you may only speak if you have been given permission to do so. To ask for permission to speak, simply ask: “PTS, STAFF?”</li>
            <li>2. You are not to go AFK without permission to do so.</li>
            <li>3. You are expected to remain where you currently stand unless instructed otherwise.</li>
            <li>4. You are to follow all orders given to you. Failure to follow any of those rules will result in a strike, 3 strikes resulting in a dismissal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Is that clear?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="jjs">
        <h2 class="section-title">Jumping Jacks (JJs)</h2>
        <p>I'll explain you what JJs are.</p>
        <p>Jumping Jacks are used in the British Army as a way to prove dedication to joining a regiment, especially elite regiments that may require more than 150 JJs.</p>
        <p>JJs can also be handed out as punishments for certain rules that you break in a regiment.</p>
        <p>It’s good to practice JJs as many events will use them and they can be given as punishments.</p>
        <p>After each jump you must say the number you are on in full capital letters.</p>
        <p>You must write each number in words, e.g. “ONE” instead of “1”.</p>
        <p>To perform a Jumping Jack, you must jump and then start counting up.</p>
        <p>I will provide a demonstration.</p>
        <p>Demonstrate about 3-5 Jumping Jacks to the attendees and then ask if they understood; if yes, move on.</p>
        <p>Assign 10-15 JJs to the attendees and ensure they all do them correctly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="drills">
        <h2 class="section-title">Drills</h2>
        <p>I'll explain you the basic drills.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Left/Right Turn: A left/right turn is called by saying ‘SQUAD, LEFT/RIGHT, TURN!’. This means to turn 90 degrees to your left or right depending on which is called.</li>
            <li>Left/Right Incline: A left/right incline is called by saying ‘SQUAD, LEFT/RIGHT, INCLINE!’. This means to turn 45 degrees to your left or right depending on which is called.</li>
            <li>About Turn: An about turn is called by saying ‘SQUAD, ABOUT, TURN!’. This means to turn 180 degrees to the right. Should you turn to the left, it will be counted as incorrect.</li>
            <li>Centre Turn: A Centre turn is called by saying “SQUAD, CENTRE, TURN!”. Face the closest 90 degrees to where the host is standing. This is the only turn to break a control turn.</li>
            <li>Control Turn: A control turn is called by saying “SQUAD, CONTROL, TURN!”. This means to face the host at all times. Only a Centre turn may break a control turn.</li>
            <li>Single File Line (SFL): A “single file line” is called by saying “SQUAD, SFL, ON ME!”. This means to form a single file line behind the host of the training.</li>
            <li>Shoulder to Shoulder (STS): A “shoulder to shoulder” is called by saying “SQUAD, STS!”. This means to either fall into the pad, or form a shoulder to shoulder line next to your fellow attendees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Is that clear?</p>
    </div>
